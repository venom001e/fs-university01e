## ‚òÅÔ∏è Self Host

FS University can be easily self-hosted for complete control and privacy. We recommend using Vercel for hosting the Next.js application and a PostgreSQL database (such as Supabase or Railway) for data storage.
Both platforms offer generous free tiers, making it cost-effective to host your own instance of FS University ü§ë.

In vercel I got 4 enviroments variables

For the first two check this guide: [Supabase guide to connect prisma](https://supabase.com/partners/integrations/prisma)

Actually, we use DATABASE_URL and DIRECT_URL because Vercel use serverless. But you can adapt the code to just use DATABASE_URL if you host nextjs in a not serverless enviroment like [Render](https://render.com/). For more info check [Prisma Docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/database-connectors/postgresql)

For more info about the nextauth enviroments check [NextAuth Docs](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options)

- DATABASE_URL
- DIRECT_URL
- NEXTAUTH_URL: fsuniversity.vercel.app
- NEXTAUTH_SECRET: very-secret-password

I will try to create a docker image in the future üôÇ
